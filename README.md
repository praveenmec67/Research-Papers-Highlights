# Research-Papers-Highlights

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I have always wished that it would be better if I can read and understand the key concept of a research paper in less than 5 mins. As an attempt towards this wish, I have tried to annotate the papers that I read and will be uploading it here. I believe this would help someone who is out there who wishes to quickly read and understand the key concept of a research article just like me. 

My area of interest and primary focus would be papers from NLP
